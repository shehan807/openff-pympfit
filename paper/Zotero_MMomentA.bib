	abstract = {Force fields are a key component of physics-based molecular modeling, describing the energies and forces in a molecular system as a function of the positions of the atoms and molecules involved. Here, we provide a review and scientific status report on the work of the Open Force Field (OpenFF) Initiative, which focuses on the science, infrastructure and data required to build the next generation of biomolecular force fields. We introduce the OpenFF Initiative and the related OpenFF Consortium, describe its approach to force field development and software, and discuss accomplishments to date as well as future plans. OpenFF releases both software and data under open and permissive licensing agreements to enable rapid application, validation, extension, and modification of its force fields and software tools. We discuss lessons learned to date in this new approach to force field development. We also highlight ways that other force field researchers can get involved, as well as some recent successes of outside researchers taking advantage of OpenFF tools and data.},

Most of the methods are quite efficient, thanks to density fitting and multi-core parallelism. The program is a hybrid of C++ and Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python API, facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to most of PSI4’s core functionalities via Python. Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) QCSCHEMA data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the MolSSI QCARCHIVE INFRASTRUCTURE project, makes the latest version of PSI4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks. The project has fostered the development of independent software components that may be reused in other quantum chemistry programs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in computational chemistry. After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow for accurately predicting the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic Schrödinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces, and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17, and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new data sets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala10): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 Å). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala10 on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala10 folds into a “wreath-shaped” configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol–1 according to the reference ab initio calculations.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry as it is ideally suited to learn representations for structured data and speed up the exploration of chemical space. While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.},

Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol−1) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.},

We show that it is possible to derive a constrained MBIS model where the atomic charges or a combination of atomic charges and dipoles exactly reproduce the molecular dipole and quadrupole moments for molecules. The atomic multipole moments derived by the constrained procedure are better at reproducing the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) than the unconstrained atomic multipole moments. They are, furthermore, significantly less conformationally dependent than atomic charges obtained by fitting to the molecular electrostatic potential.},

In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

	abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool to study the mechanisms that dominate the properties of ionic liquids (ILs) on the atomistic and molecular level. However, the basis for any molecular dynamics simulation is an accurate force field describing the effective interactions between all atoms in the IL. Normally this is done by empirical potentials which can be partially derived from quantum mechanical calculations on simple subunits or have been fitted to experimental data. Unfortunately, the number of accurate classical non-polarizable models for ILs that allow a reasonable description of both dynamical and statical properties is still low. However, the strongly increasing computational power allows one to apply computationally more expensive methods, and even polarizable-force-field-based models on time and length scales long enough to ensure a proper sampling of the phase space. This review attempts to summarize recent achievements and methods in the development of classical force fields for ionic liquids. As this class of salts covers a large number of compounds, we focus our review on imidazolium-based ionic liquids, but show that the main conclusions are valid for non-imidazolium salts, too. Insight obtained from recent electronic density functional results into the parametrization of partial charges and on the influence of polarization effects in bulk ILs is highlighted. An overview is given of different available force fields, ranging from the atomistic to the coarse-grained level, covering implicit as well as explicit modeling of polarization. We show that the recently popular usage of the ion charge as fit parameter can looked upon as treating polarization effects in a mean-field matter.},

For both ILs, the total charge was found to be ±0.8 e for the cation and anion, respectively, due to the charge transfer between ions and polarization caused by the environment. These atomic charges were used in a force field developed within the general Amber force field framework. Using this force field, static, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties were computed for the two ILs using molecular dynamics simulation. The results were compared against results obtained using the same Amber force field but four different sets of partial charges, denoted as full charge, scaled charge, AIMD-l charge, and AIMD-b charge, respectively. The full charge was derived from quantum chemistry calculation of isolated ions in a vacuum and resulted in a total charge of unity on each ion. The scaled charge was obtained by uniformly scaling the full charge by 0.8. AIMD-l and AIMD-b charges were derived from liquid phase ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The scaled charges have the same total charge on the ions as the AIMD-c charge but different distributions. It was found that simulation results not only depend on the total charge of each ion, but they are also sensitive to the charge distribution within an ion, especially for dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Overall, for the two ILs under study, the AIMD-c charge was found to predict experimental results better than the other four sets of charges, indicating that fitting charges from crystal phase DFT calculations, instead of extensive sampling of the liquid phase configurations, is a simple and reliable way to derive atomic charges for condensed phase ionic liquid simulations.},

Whether additive atomic charge models or polarizable induced dipole models are used, proper parameterization of the electrostatic term plays a key role in the force field developments. In this work, we present a Python program called PyRESP for performing atomic multipole parameterizations by reproducing ab initio electrostatic potential (ESP) around molecules. PyRESP provides parameterization schemes for several electrostatic models, including the RESP model with atomic charges for the additive force fields and the RESP-ind and RESP-perm models with additional induced and permanent dipole moments for the polarizable force fields. PyRESP is a flexible and user-friendly program that can accommodate various needs during force field parameterizations for molecular modeling of any organic molecules.},

The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by AM1 atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit BCCs simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 BCC parameters. AM1-BCC yields charge sets of comparable quality to HF/6-31G* ESP-derived charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct ESP-fit methods. We then apply the BCC parameters to a small “test set” consisting of aspirin, d-glucose, and eryodictyol; the AM1-BCC model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with HF/6-31G* RESP charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square (RMS) error in ESP. Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the AM1-BCC model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {R.E.D. Server is a unique, open web service, designed to derive non-polarizable RESP and ESP charges and to build force field libraries for new molecules/molecular fragments. It provides to computational biologists the means to derive rigorously molecular electrostatic potential-based charges embedded in force field libraries that are ready to be used in force field development, charge validation and molecular dynamics simulations. R.E.D. Server interfaces quantum mechanics programs, the RESP program and the latest version of the R.E.D. tools. A two step approach has been developed. The first one consists of preparing P2N file(s) to rigorously define key elements such as atom names, topology and chemical equivalencing needed when building a force field library. Then, P2N files are used to derive RESP or ESP charges embedded in force field libraries in the Tripos mol2 format. In complex cases an entire set of force field libraries or force field topology database is generated. Other features developed in R.E.D. Server include help services, a demonstration, tutorials, frequently asked questions, Jmol-based tools useful to construct PDB input files and parse R.E.D. Server outputs as well as a graphical queuing system allowing any user to check the status of R.E.D. Server jobs.},

We define an object function of fitting as an integration of the difference of electrostatic potentials in the entire 3-dimensional physical space. The object function is thus rotationally invariant with respect to the molecular orientation and varies smoothly with respect to molecular geometric fluctuations. Compared with commonly employed methods such as the Merz−Singh−Kollman and CHELPG schemes, this new method, while possessing comparable accuracy, shows greatly improved numerical stability with respect to the molecular positions and geometries. The method can be used in the fitting of electrostatic potentials for the molecular mechanics force fields and also can be applied to the calculation of electrostatic polarizabilites of molecular or atomic systems.},

After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

However, experimental discovery is limited by the complexity of synthesizing and testing new monomer and polymer chemistries. In this study, we benchmark the ability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Class 1 force fields to model the transport and structural properties of polymer electrolytes in a high-throughput screening setting. By systematically comparing simulation results to experimental data for 19 polymers, we evaluate the effect of simulation choices in predicting key transport properties. In particular, we evaluate the convergence of diffusivities and conductivities as a function of simulation length and how inaccuracies in modeling polymer glass-transition temperature carry over to ion transport properties. The results highlight both the strengths and limitations of affordable high-throughput MD simulations for these complex systems, providing insights into the optimization of MD simulations for polymer electrolyte research and recommendations for modeling choices with optimal cost-accuracy trade-offs. Furthermore, we perform in-depth transport and structural property analysis across the polymer space to gain insights into the design of new polymer electrolytes.},

	abstract = {Solid polymer electrolytes are an exciting solution for safe and stable solid lithium electrode battery systems but are hindered by low ionic conductivity and low lithium transference. All-atom molecular dynamics simulation has become an invaluable tool to probe lithium diffusion mechanisms and accelerate the discovery of promising polymer chemistries. Because of their low computational cost and despite their approximate nature, only classical interatomic potentials can access the time and length scales for appropriate statistics of polymer kinetics. Machine learning (ML) potentials trained end-to-end on ab initio data have proven more accurate but cannot be scaled to the necessary time- and length- scales yet. Historical approaches to parametrize classical force fields have been incremental, reliant on a manual combination of top-down and bottom-up fitting, and are often paywalled and hard to reproduce. We introduce a computational learning workflow to predict classical interatomic potential parameters using quantum mechanical computations as training data that combines the automation and end-to-end fitting of ML with traditional class 1 and class 2 functional forms. The fitting strategy produced potentials whose simulations improved the accuracy of lithium coordination environments, diffusivities, and conductivities relative to experimental approaches when compared to both naive and hand-tuned parameters for liquid and solid organic electrolyte systems. We show that chemistry-informed regularization is necessary to constrain predicted parameters in order to reproduce experimental solvation and kinetic properties. Finally, we explore the limitations of nonpolarizable, fixed point-charge schemes in describing electrolyte anions and compare the effects of two alternative schemes to fit point-charge distributions. The two strategies result in distinct lithium coordination mechanisms and highlight that closest parity to DFT forces and energies does not correlate to correct trends with lithium salt concentration in kinetic and solvation properties for fixed-point-charge classical interatomic potentials.},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Partial atomic charges are usually used to calculate the electrostatic component of energy in many molecular modeling applications, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations and so forth. High-level quantum mechanics calculations may provide the most accurate way to estimate the partial charges for small molecules, but they are too time-consuming to be used to process a large number of molecules for high throughput virtual screening.We proposed a new molecule descriptor named Atom-Path-Descriptor (APD) and developed a set of APD-based machine learning (ML) models to predict the partial charges for small molecules with high accuracy. In the APD algorithm, the 3D structures of molecules were assigned with atom centers and atom-pair path-based atom layers to characterize the local chemical environments of atoms. Then, based on the APDs, two representative ensemble ML algorithms, i.e. random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were employed to develop the regression models for partial charge assignment. The results illustrate that the RF models based on APDs give better predictions for all the atom types than those based on traditional molecular fingerprints reported in the previous study. More encouragingly, the models trained by XGBoost can improve the predictions of partial charges further, and they can achieve the average root-mean-square error 0.0116 e on the external test set, which is much lower than that (0.0195 e) reported in the previous study, suggesting that the proposed algorithm is quite promising to be used in partial charge assignment with high accuracy.

	abstract = {The ability to accurately and efficiently compute quantum-mechanical partial atomistic charges has many practical applications, such as calculations of IR spectra, analysis of chemical bonding, and classical force field parametrization. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a possible avenue for the efficient prediction of atomic partial charges. Modern ML advances in the prediction of molecular energies [i.e., the hierarchical interacting particle neural network (HIP-NN)] has provided the necessary model framework and architecture to predict transferable, extensible, and conformationally dynamic atomic partial charges based on reference density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Utilizing HIP-NN, we show that ML charge prediction can be highly accurate over a wide range of molecules (both small and large) across a variety of charge partitioning schemes such as the Hirshfeld, CM5, MSK, and NBO methods. To demonstrate transferability and size extensibility, we compare ML results with reference DFT calculations on the COMP6 benchmark, achieving errors of 0.004e– (elementary charge). This is remarkable since this benchmark contains two proteins that are multiple times larger than the largest molecules in the training set. An application of our atomic charge predictions on nonequilibrium geometries is the generation of IR spectra for organic molecules from dynamical trajectories on a variety of organic molecules, which show good agreement with calculated IR spectra with reference method. Critically, HIP-NN charge predictions are many orders of magnitude faster than direct DFT calculations. These combined results provide further evidence that ML (specifically HIP-NN) provides a pathway to greatly increase the range of feasible simulations while retaining quantum-level accuracy.},

This emerging field has witnessed an extensive growth of promising techniques that have been applied with success to computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. But for any successful field to become mainstream and reliable, benchmarks must be developed to quantify progress. This led us in March 2020 to release a benchmark framework that i) comprises of a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, ii) enables fair model comparison with the same parameter budget to identify key architectures, iii) has an open-source, easy-to-use and reproducible code infrastructure, and iv) is flexible for researchers to experiment with new theoretical ideas. As of December 2022, the GitHub repository has reached 2,000 stars and 380 forks, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed open-source framework through the wide usage by the GNN community. In this paper, we present an updated version of our benchmark with a concise presentation of the aforementioned framework characteristics, an additional medium-sized molecular dataset AQSOL, similar to the popular ZINC, but with a real-world measured chemical target, and discuss how this framework can be leveraged to explore new GNN designs and insights. As a proof of value of our benchmark, we study the case of graph positional encoding (PE) in GNNs, which was introduced with this benchmark and has since spurred interest of exploring more powerful PE for Transformers and GNNs in a robust experimental setting.},

This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds.

The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds.

Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of structural and dynamic properties of 30 commonly used 3-point, 4-point, 5-point, and polarizable water models simulated using consistent settings and analysis methods. For the properties of density, coordination number, surface tension, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficient, and solvation free energy of methane, models published within the past two decades consistently show better agreement with experimental values compared to models published earlier, albeit with some notable exceptions. However, no single model reproduced all experimental values exactly, highlighting the need to carefully choose a water model for a particular study, depending on the phenomena of interest. Finally, machine learning algorithms quantified the relationship between the water model force field parameters and the resulting bulk properties, providing insight into the parameter–property relationship and illustrating the challenges of developing a water model that can accurately reproduce all properties of water simultaneously.},

In particular, this failure seriously impacts the long- and medium-range interaction energies of the DFTB plus dispersion (DFTB-D) model, leading to incorrect predictions of translational or rotational barriers in such systems. We show explicitly on examples of H2 and N2 that correct quadrupole moments—and consequently correct electrostatic interactions—can be restored in such systems by adding additional bond (ghost) sites to the homonuclear molecules. Attempts to determine the point charges associated with the additional sites using the usual Mulliken population analysis lead to unphysical results. Instead, these charges can be determined using the actual DFTB densities used in the parameterization process. For homonuclear molecules, we propose an extension to the DFTB-D model by adding charges that reproduce the physically correct quadrupolar charge distribution. The resulting DFTB-D-Q model greatly improves the rotational barriers for interactions of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen with benzene.},

	abstract = {The simulation of metals, oxides, and hydroxides can accelerate the design of therapeutics, alloys, catalysts, cement-based materials, ceramics, bioinspired composites, and glasses. Here we introduce the INTERFACE force field (IFF) and surface models for α-Al2O3, α-Cr2O3, α-Fe2O3, NiO, CaO, MgO, β-Ca(OH)2, β-Mg(OH)2, and β-Ni(OH)2. The force field parameters are nonbonded, including atomic charges for Coulomb interactions, Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials for van der Waals interactions with 12–6 and 9–6 options, and harmonic bond stretching for hydroxide ions. The models outperform DFT calculations and earlier atomistic models (Pedone, ReaxFF, UFF, CLAYFF) up to 2 orders of magnitude in reliability, compatibility, and interpretability due to a quantitative representation of chemical bonding consistent with other compounds across the periodic table and curated experimental data for validation. The IFF models exhibit average deviations of 0.2\% in lattice parameters, {\textless}10\% in surface energies (to the extent known), and 6\% in bulk moduli relative to experiments. The parameters and models can be used with existing parameters for solvents, inorganic compounds, organic compounds, biomolecules, and polymers in IFF, CHARMM, CVFF, AMBER, OPLS-AA, PCFF, and COMPASS, to simulate bulk oxides, hydroxides, electrolyte interfaces, and multiphase, biological, and organic hybrid materials at length scales from atoms to micrometers. The nonbonded character of the models also enables the analysis of mixed oxides, glasses, and certain chemical reactions, and well-performing nonbonded models for silica phases, SiO2, are introduced. Automated model building is available in the CHARMM-GUI Nanomaterial Modeler. We illustrate applications of the models to predict the structure of mixed oxides, and energy barriers of ion migration, as well as binding energies of water and organic molecules in outstanding agreement with experimental data and calculations at the CCSD(T) level. Examples of model building for hydrated, pH-sensitive oxide surfaces to simulate solid-electrolyte interfaces are discussed.},

	abstract = {Computational high-throughput screening using molecular simulations is a powerful tool for identifying top-performing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas storage and separation applications. Accurate partial atomic charges are often required to model the electrostatic interactions between the MOF and the adsorbate, especially when the adsorption involves molecules with dipole or quadrupole moments such as water and CO2. Although ab initio methods can be used to calculate accurate partial atomic charges, these methods are impractical for screening large material databases because of the high computational cost. We developed a random forest machine learning model to predict the partial atomic charges in MOFs using a small yet meaningful set of features that represent both the elemental properties and the local environment of each atom. The model was trained and tested on a collection of about 320 000 density-derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) atomic charges calculated on a subset of the Computation-Ready Experimental Metal–Organic Framework (CoRE MOF-2019) database and separately on charge model 5 (CM5) charges. The model predicts accurate atomic charges for MOFs at a fraction of the computational cost of periodic density functional theory (DFT) and is found to be transferable to other porous molecular crystals and zeolites. A strong correlation is observed between the partial atomic charge and the average electronegativity difference between the central atom and its bonded neighbors.},

RESP uses a quantum-mechanical method that yields fortuitous overpolarization and thereby accounts only approximately for self-polarization of molecules in the condensed phase. Here we present RESP2, a next generation of this approach, where the polarity of the charges is tuned by a parameter, δ, which scales the contributions from gas- and aqueous-phase calculations. When the complete non-bonded force field model, including Lennard-Jones parameters, is optimized to liquid properties, improved accuracy is achieved, even with this reduced set of five Lennard-Jones types. We argue that RESP2 with δ ≈ 0.6 (60\% aqueous, 40\% gas-phase charges) is an accurate and robust method of generating partial charges, and that a small set of Lennard-Jones types is a good starting point for a systematic re-optimization of this important non-bonded term.},

	abstract = {Parametrization of small organic molecules for classical molecular dynamics simulations is not trivial. The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an individual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semiempirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a (bio)molecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of druglike molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the three-dimensional conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP). To assess the quality and compatibility with standard force fields, we performed benchmark calculations for the free energy of hydration and liquid properties such as density and heat of vaporization.},

	abstract = {The molecular dipole moment (μ) is a central quantity in chemistry. It is essential in predicting infrared and sum-frequency generation spectra as well as induction and long-range electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, it can be extracted directly—via the ground state electron density—from high-level quantum mechanical calculations, making it an ideal target for machine learning (ML). In this work, we choose to represent this quantity with a physically inspired ML model that captures two distinct physical effects: local atomic polarization is captured within the symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression framework which assigns a (vector) dipole moment to each atom, while the movement of charge across the entire molecule is captured by assigning a partial (scalar) charge to each atom. The resulting “MuML” models are fitted together to reproduce molecular μ computed using high-level coupled-cluster theory and density functional theory (DFT) on the QM7b dataset, achieving more accurate results due to the physics-based combination of these complementary terms. The combined model shows excellent transferability when applied to a showcase dataset of larger and more complex molecules, approaching the accuracy of DFT at a small fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that the uncertainty in the predictions can be estimated reliably using a calibrated committee model. The ultimate performance of the models—and the optimal weighting of their combination—depends, however, on the details of the system at hand, with the scalar model being clearly superior when describing large molecules whose dipole is almost entirely generated by charge separation. These observations point to the importance of simultaneously accounting for the local and non-local effects that contribute to μ; furthermore, they define a challenging task to benchmark future models, particularly those aimed at the description of condensed phases.},

	abstract = {Explicit description of atomic polarizability is critical for the accurate treatment of inter-molecular interactions by force fields (FFs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aiming to investigate complex electrostatic environments such as metal-binding sites of metalloproteins. Several models exist to describe key monovalent and divalent cations interacting with proteins. Many of these models have been developed from ion–amino-acid interactions and/or aqueous-phase data on cation solvation. The transferability of these models to cation–protein interactions remains uncertain. Herein, we assess the accuracy of existing FFs by their abilities to reproduce hierarchies of thousands of Ca2+–dipeptide interaction energies based on density-functional theory calculations. We find that the Drude polarizable FF, prior to any parameterization, better approximates the QM interaction energies than any of the non-polarizable FFs. Nevertheless, it required improvement in order to address polarization catastrophes where, at short Ca2+–carboxylate distances, the Drude particle of oxygen overlaps with the divalent cation. To ameliorate this, we identified those conformational properties that produced the poorest prediction of interaction energies to reduce the parameter space for optimization. We then optimized the selected cation–peptide parameters using Boltzmann-weighted fitting and evaluated the resulting parameters in MD simulations of the N-lobe of calmodulin. We also parameterized and evaluated the CTPOL FF, which incorporates charge-transfer and polarization effects in additive FFs. This work shows how QM-driven parameter development, followed by testing in condensed-phase simulations, may yield FFs that can accurately capture the structure and dynamics of ion–protein interactions.},

Traditionally, the assignment of partial charges has relied on surrogates of ab initio semiempirical quantum chemical methods such as AM1-BCC and is expensive for large systems or large numbers of molecules. We propose a hybrid physical/graph neural network-based approximation to the widely popular AM1-BCC charge model that is orders of magnitude faster while maintaining accuracy comparable to differences in AM1-BCC implementations. Our hybrid approach couples a graph neural network to a streamlined charge equilibration approach in order to predict molecule-specific atomic electronegativity and hardness parameters, followed by analytical determination of optimal charge-equilibrated parameters that preserve total molecular charge. This hybrid approach scales linearly with the number of atoms, enabling for the first time the use of fully consistent charge models for small molecules and biopolymers for the construction of next-generation self-consistent biomolecular force fields. Implemented in the free and open source package EspalomaCharge, this approach provides drop-in replacements for both AmberTools antechamber and the Open Force Field Toolkit charging workflows, in addition to stand-alone charge generation interfaces.

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {Summary This paper introduces FireWorks, a workflow software for running high-throughput calculation workflows at supercomputing centers. FireWorks has been used to complete over 50 million CPU-hours worth of computational chemistry and materials science calculations at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center. It has been designed to serve the demanding high-throughput computing needs of these applications, with extensive support for (i) concurrent execution through job packing, (ii) failure detection and correction, (iii) provenance and reporting for long-running projects, (iv) automated duplicate detection, and (v) dynamic workflows (i.e., modifying the workflow graph during runtime). We have found that these features are highly relevant to enabling modern data-driven and high-throughput science applications, and we discuss our implementation strategy that rests on Python and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). Finally, we present performance data and limitations of our approach along with planned future work. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM. This makes it an ideal tool for researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new methods to be immediately available to the larger community.},

Built on top of open source Python packages already in use by the materials community such as pymatgen, FireWorks, and custodian, atomate provides well-tested workflow templates to compute various materials properties such as electronic bandstructure, elastic properties, and piezoelectric, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties. Atomate also enables the computational characterization of materials by providing workflows that calculate X-ray absorption (XAS), Electron energy loss (EELS) and Raman spectra. One of the major features of atomate is that it provides both fully functional workflows as well as reusable components that enable one to compose complex materials science workflows that use a diverse set of computational tools. Additionally, atomate creates output databases that organize the results from individual calculations and contains a builder framework that creates summary reports for each computed material based on multiple simulations.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to specifying a molecular mechanics force field encode all the information needed to assign force field parameters to a given molecule into a discrete set of atom types. This is equivalent to a representation consisting of a molecular graph comprising a set of vertices, which represent atoms labeled by atom type, and unlabeled edges, which represent chemical bonds. Bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral parameters are then assigned by looking up bonded pairs, triplets, and quartets of atom types in parameter tables to assign valence terms and using the atom types themselves to assign nonbonded parameters. This approach, which we call indirect chemical perception because it operates on the intermediate graph of atom-typed nodes, creates a number of technical problems. For example, atom types must be sufficiently complex to encode all necessary information about the molecular environment, making it difficult to extend force fields encoded this way. Atom typing also results in a proliferation of redundant parameters applied to chemically equivalent classes of valence terms, needlessly increasing force field complexity. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning force field parameters via direct chemical perception. Rather than working through the intermediary of the atom-typed graph, direct chemical perception operates directly on the unmodified chemical graph of the molecule to assign parameters. In particular, parameters are assigned to each type of force field term (e.g., bond stretch, angle bend, torsion, and Lennard–Jones) based on standard chemical substructure queries implemented via the industry-standard SMARTS chemical perception language, using SMIRKS extensions that permit labeling of specific atoms within a chemical pattern. We use this to implement a new force field format, called the SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format. We demonstrate the power and generality of this approach using examples of specific molecules that pose problems for indirect chemical perception and construct and validate a minimalist yet very general force field, SMIRNOFF99Frosst. We find that a parameter definition file only ∼300 lines long provides coverage of all but {\textless}0.02\% of a 5 million molecule drug-like test set. Despite its simplicity, the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst for small molecule hydration free energies and selected properties of pure organic liquids is similar to that of the General Amber Force Field, whose specification requires thousands of parameters. This force field provides a starting point for further optimization and refitting work to follow.},

	volume = {9},
	doi = {10.21105/joss.05995},
	abstract = {We present Jobflow, a domain-agnostic Python package for writing computational workflows tailored for high-throughput computing applications. With its simple decorator-based approach, functions and class methods can be transformed into compute jobs that can be stitched together into complex workflows. Jobflow fully supports dynamic workflows where the full acyclic graph of compute jobs is not known until runtime, such as compute jobs that launch other jobs based on the results of previous steps in the workflow. The results of all Jobflow compute jobs can be easily stored in a variety of filesystem-and cloud-based databases without the data storage process being part of the underlying workflow logic itself. Jobflow has been intentionally designed to be fully independent of the choice of workflow manager used to dispatch the calculations on remote computing resources. At the time of writing, Jobflow workflows can be executed either locally or across distributed compute environments via an adapter to the FireWorks package, and Jobflow fully supports the integration of additional workflow execution adapters in the future. Statement of Need The current era of big data and high-performance computing has emphasized the significant need for robust, flexible, and scalable workflow management solutions that can be used to efficiently orchestrate scientific calculations (Ben-Nun et al., 2020; Da Silva et al., 2023). To date, a wide variety of workflow systems have been developed, and it has become clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution due to the diverse needs of the computational community (Al-Saadi et al., 2021; Existing Workflow Systems, 2023). While several popular software packages in this space have emerged over the last decade, many of them require the user to tailor their domain-specific code with the underlying workflow management framework closely in mind. This can be a barrier to entry for many users and puts significant constraints on the Rosen et al. (2024). Jobflow: Computational Workflows Made Simple.
