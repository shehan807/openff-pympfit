	abstract = {Force fields are a key component of physics-based molecular modeling, describing the energies and forces in a molecular system as a function of the positions of the atoms and molecules involved. Here, we provide a review and scientific status report on the work of the Open Force Field (OpenFF) Initiative, which focuses on the science, infrastructure and data required to build the next generation of biomolecular force fields. We introduce the OpenFF Initiative and the related OpenFF Consortium, describe its approach to force field development and software, and discuss accomplishments to date as well as future plans. OpenFF releases both software and data under open and permissive licensing agreements to enable rapid application, validation, extension, and modification of its force fields and software tools. We discuss lessons learned to date in this new approach to force field development. We also highlight ways that other force field researchers can get involved, as well as some recent successes of outside researchers taking advantage of OpenFF tools and data.},

	abstract = {High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations have become a vital element of computational materials science, enabling materials screening, property database generation, and training of “universal” machine learning models. While several software frameworks have emerged to support these computational efforts, new developments such as machine learned force fields have increased demands for more flexible and programmable workflow solutions. This manuscript introduces atomate2, a comprehensive evolution of our original atomate framework, designed to address existing limitations in computational materials research infrastructure. Key features include the support for multiple electronic structure packages and interoperability between them, along with generalizable workflows that can be written in an abstract form irrespective of the DFT package or machine learning force field used within them. Our hope is that atomate2's improved usability and extensibility can reduce technical barriers for high-throughput research workflows and facilitate the rapid adoption of emerging methods in computational material science.},

	volume = {9},
	doi = {10.21105/joss.05995},
	abstract = {We present Jobflow, a domain-agnostic Python package for writing computational workflows tailored for high-throughput computing applications. With its simple decorator-based approach, functions and class methods can be transformed into compute jobs that can be stitched together into complex workflows. Jobflow fully supports dynamic workflows where the full acyclic graph of compute jobs is not known until runtime, such as compute jobs that launch other jobs based on the results of previous steps in the workflow. The results of all Jobflow compute jobs can be easily stored in a variety of filesystem-and cloud-based databases without the data storage process being part of the underlying workflow logic itself. Jobflow has been intentionally designed to be fully independent of the choice of workflow manager used to dispatch the calculations on remote computing resources. At the time of writing, Jobflow workflows can be executed either locally or across distributed compute environments via an adapter to the FireWorks package, and Jobflow fully supports the integration of additional workflow execution adapters in the future. Statement of Need The current era of big data and high-performance computing has emphasized the significant need for robust, flexible, and scalable workflow management solutions that can be used to efficiently orchestrate scientific calculations (Ben-Nun et al., 2020; Da Silva et al., 2023). To date, a wide variety of workflow systems have been developed, and it has become clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution due to the diverse needs of the computational community (Al-Saadi et al., 2021; Existing Workflow Systems, 2023). While several popular software packages in this space have emerged over the last decade, many of them require the user to tailor their domain-specific code with the underlying workflow management framework closely in mind. This can be a barrier to entry for many users and puts significant constraints on the Rosen et al. (2024). Jobflow: Computational Workflows Made Simple.

The program is a hybrid of C++ and Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python API, facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to most of PSI4’s core functionalities via Python. Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) QCSCHEMA data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the MolSSI QCARCHIVE INFRASTRUCTURE project, makes the latest version of PSI4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks.

It has been designed to serve the demanding high-throughput computing needs of these applications, with extensive support for (i) concurrent execution through job packing, (ii) failure detection and correction, (iii) provenance and reporting for long-running projects, (iv) automated duplicate detection, and (v) dynamic workflows (i.e., modifying the workflow graph during runtime). We have found that these features are highly relevant to enabling modern data-driven and high-throughput science applications, and we discuss our implementation strategy that rests on Python and NoSQL databases (MongoDB).

	abstract = {The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed, accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique 3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only {\textasciitilde}50M active parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to build increasingly capable AI models.},

However, experimental discovery is limited by the complexity of synthesizing and testing new monomer and polymer chemistries. In this study, we benchmark the ability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Class 1 force fields to model the transport and structural properties of polymer electrolytes in a high-throughput screening setting. By systematically comparing simulation results to experimental data for 19 polymers, we evaluate the effect of simulation choices in predicting key transport properties. In particular, we evaluate the convergence of diffusivities and conductivities as a function of simulation length and how inaccuracies in modeling polymer glass-transition temperature carry over to ion transport properties. The results highlight both the strengths and limitations of affordable high-throughput MD simulations for these complex systems, providing insights into the optimization of MD simulations for polymer electrolyte research and recommendations for modeling choices with optimal cost-accuracy trade-offs. Furthermore, we perform in-depth transport and structural property analysis across the polymer space to gain insights into the design of new polymer electrolytes.},

	abstract = {The AM1-BCC method quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for use in condensed-phase simulations. The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by AM1 atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit BCCs simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 BCC parameters. AM1-BCC yields charge sets of comparable quality to HF/6-31G* ESP-derived charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct ESP-fit methods. We then apply the BCC parameters to a small “test set” consisting of aspirin, d-glucose, and eryodictyol; the AM1-BCC model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with HF/6-31G* RESP charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square (RMS) error in ESP. Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the AM1-BCC model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

	abstract = {With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,'' or into partial and total ``net atomic populations'' together with ``overlap populations.'' ``Gross atomic populations'' distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded.Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the π bonds in CO, the σ and π overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the π electrons is about twice that for the σ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94\% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.},

Thus, it is possible to obtain 6-31G* quality point charges by simply scaling MNDO ESP charges. The charges are scaled in a linear (y = Mx) manner to conserve charge. In this way researchers desiring to carry out force field simulations or minimizations can obtain charges by using MNDO, which requires much less computer time than the corresponding 6-31G* calculation.},

We describe how the CamCASP suite of programs can be used to generate such potentials using some of the most accurate electronic structure methods currently applicable. We derive the long-range terms from monomer properties and determine the short-range anisotropy parameters by a novel and robust method based on the iterated stockholder atom approach. Using these techniques, we develop distributed multipole models for the electrostatic, polarization, and dispersion interactions in the pyridine dimer and develop a series of many-body potentials for the pyridine system. Even the simplest of these potentials exhibits root mean square errors of only about 0.6 kJ mol–1 for the low-energy pyridine dimers, significantly surpassing the best empirical potentials. Our best model is shown to support eight stable minima, four of which have not been reported before in the literature. Further, the functional form can be made systematically more elaborate so as to improve the accuracy without a significant increase in the human-time spent in their generation. We investigate the effects of anisotropy, rank of multipoles, and choice of polarizability and dispersion models.},

We illuminate physical trends in the liquid cohesive energy with cation chain length and anion. These trends are different than those based on the experimental heats of vaporization. Molecular dynamics prediction of the room temperature dynamics of such ILs is more difficult than is generally realized in the literature due to large statistical uncertainties and sensitivity to subtle force field details.

Furthermore, parameters obtained in gas phase are substantiated in liquid-phase simulations. The hydration free energy (HFE) of neutral and charged molecules have been calculated and compared with experimental values. The RMS error for the HFE of neutral molecules is less than 1 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, the relative error in the predicted HFE of salts (cations and anions) is less than 3\% with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. Overall, the performance of Poltype is satisfactory and provides a convenient utility for applications such as drug discovery. Further improvement can be achieved by the systematic study of various organic compounds, particularly ionic molecules, and refinement and expansion of the parameter database.},

The widely adopted additive force fields typically use fixed atom-centered partial charges to model electrostatic interactions. However, the additive force fields cannot accurately model polarization effects, leading to unrealistic simulations in polarization-sensitive processes. Numerous efforts have been invested in developing induced dipole-based polarizable force fields. Whether additive atomic charge models or polarizable induced dipole models are used, proper parameterization of the electrostatic term plays a key role in the force field developments. In this work, we present a Python program called PyRESP for performing atomic multipole parameterizations by reproducing ab initio electrostatic potential (ESP) around molecules. PyRESP provides parameterization schemes for several electrostatic models, including the RESP model with atomic charges for the additive force fields and the RESP-ind and RESP-perm models with additional induced and permanent dipole moments for the polarizable force fields. PyRESP is a flexible and user-friendly program that can accommodate various needs during force field parameterizations for molecular modeling of any organic molecules.},

Graph neural network (GNN) based continuous atom embeddings have been shown to be a fast and flexible solution for partial charge assignment, but those developed so far for condensed phase modeling have usually been trained to reproduce AM1-BCC charges, which themselves seek to reproduce the HF/6-31G(d) molecular electrostatic potential. Here, we investigate the suitability of various common charge assignment schemes, including ESP and atoms-in-molecule (AIM) based approaches, as training targets for new GNN-based charge models. We show that the strengths of both approaches can be combined by cotraining GNN models to AIM charges and molecular dipoles and electrostatic potentials. We collect a data set of quantum mechanical AIM properties computed at a high level of theory (ωB97X-D/def2-tzvpp), in both vacuum and implicit solvent, and train new GNN charge models to each. Charges can be scaled between the vacuum and solvated charge sets, and combined with Lennard-Jones parameters optimized using the Open Force Field infrastructure, to yield force fields that are suitably polarized for condensed phase modeling. We further demonstrate that the charge models may be applied to explore electrostatics-driven structure–activity relationships in medicinal chemistry.

Traditionally, the assignment of partial charges has relied on surrogates of ab initio semiempirical quantum chemical methods such as AM1-BCC and is expensive for large systems or large numbers of molecules. We propose a hybrid physical/graph neural network-based approximation to the widely popular AM1-BCC charge model that is orders of magnitude faster while maintaining accuracy comparable to differences in AM1-BCC implementations. Our hybrid approach couples a graph neural network to a streamlined charge equilibration approach in order to predict molecule-specific atomic electronegativity and hardness parameters, followed by analytical determination of optimal charge-equilibrated parameters that preserve total molecular charge. This hybrid approach scales linearly with the number of atoms, enabling for the first time the use of fully consistent charge models for small molecules and biopolymers for the construction of next-generation self-consistent biomolecular force fields. Implemented in the free and open source package EspalomaCharge, this approach provides drop-in replacements for both AmberTools antechamber and the Open Force Field Toolkit charging workflows, in addition to stand-alone charge generation interfaces.

	abstract = {We present a robust and computationally efficient approach for assigning partial charges of atoms in molecules. The method is based on a hierarchical tree constructed from attention values extracted from a graph neural network (GNN), which was trained to predict atomic partial charges from accurate quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations. The resulting dynamic attention-based substructure hierarchy (DASH) approach provides fast assignment of partial charges with the same accuracy as the GNN itself, is software-independent, and can easily be integrated in existing parametrization pipelines, as shown for the Open force field (OpenFF). The implementation of the DASH workflow, the final DASH tree, and the training set are available as open source/open data from public repositories.},

	abstract = {A next-generation protocol (Poltype 2) has been developed which automatically generates AMOEBA polarizable force field parameters for small molecules. Both features and computational efficiency have been drastically improved. Notable advances include improved database transferability using SMILES, robust torsion fitting, non-aromatic ring torsion parameterization, coupled torsion-torsion parameterization, Van der Waals parameter refinement using ab initio dimer data and an intelligent fragmentation scheme that produces parameters with dramatically reduced ab initio computational cost. Additional improvements include better local frame assignment for atomic multipoles, automated formal charge assignment, Zwitterion detection, smart memory resource defaults, parallelized fragment job submission, incorporation of Psi4 quantum package, ab initio error handling, ionization state enumeration, hydration free energy prediction and binding free energy prediction. For validation, we have applied Poltype 2 to 1000 FDA approved drug molecules from DrugBank. The ab initio molecular dipole moments and electrostatic potential values were compared with Poltype 2 derived AMOEBA counterparts. Parameters were further substantiated by calculating hydration free energy (HFE) on 40 small organic molecules and were compared with experimental data, resulting in an RMSE error of 0.59 kcal/mol. The torsion database has expanded to include 3543 fragments derived from FDA approved drugs. Poltype 2 provides a convenient utility for applications including binding free energy prediction for computational drug discovery. Further improvement will focus on automated parameter refinement by experimental liquid properties, expansion of the Van der Waals parameter database and automated parametrization of modified bio-fragments such as amino and nucleic acids.},

	abstract = {The minimal basis iterative Stockholder (MBIS) decomposition of molecular electron densities into atomic quantities is an attractive approach for deriving electrostatic parameters in force fields. The MBIS-derived atomic charges, however, in general tend to overestimate the molecular dipole and quadrupole moments by ∼10\%. We show that it is possible to derive a constrained MBIS model where the atomic charges or a combination of atomic charges and dipoles exactly reproduce the molecular dipole and quadrupole moments for molecules. The atomic multipole moments derived by the constrained procedure are better at reproducing the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) than the unconstrained atomic multipole moments. They are, furthermore, significantly less conformationally dependent than atomic charges obtained by fitting to the molecular electrostatic potential.},

	abstract = {Psi4 is an ab initio electronic structure program providing methods such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, configuration interaction, and coupled-cluster theory. The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the “X2C” approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm to compute the lattice energies of molecular crystals based on the many-body cluster expansion. The required computations on dimers, trimers, etc., within the crystal are independent of each other, leading to a naturally parallel approach. The algorithm exploits the long-range three-dimensional periodic order of crystals to automatically detect and avoid redundant or unnecessary computations. For this purpose, Coulomb-matrix descriptors from machine learning applications are found to be efficient in determining whether two N-mers are identical. The algorithm is implemented as an open-source Python program, CrystaLattE, that uses some of the features of the Quantum Chemistry Common Driver and Databases library. CrystaLattE is initially interfaced with the quantum chemistry package Psi4. With CrystaLattE, we have applied the fast, dispersion-corrected Hartree–Fock method HF-3c to the lattice energy of crystalline benzene. Including all 73 symmetry-unique dimers and 7130 symmetry-unique trimers that can be formed from molecules within a 15 Å cutoff from a central reference monomer, HF-3c plus an Axilrod-Teller-Muto estimate of three-body dispersion exhibits an error of only −1.0 kJ mol−1 vs the estimated 0 K experimental lattice energy of −55.3 ± 2.2 kJ mol−1. The convergence of the HF-3c two- and three-body contributions to the lattice energy as a function of intermonomer distance is examined.},
